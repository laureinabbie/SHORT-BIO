I am Laurein Abigail R. Ayala of 2ECE-D, 19 years old and was born on the 18th of February, year 2000. I was born in Lucena City
but eventually transferred to Laguna when I was in 3rd grade. During my free time, I sing, dance, compose songs, sketch dresses and play
the ultimate love of my life right now, which too, is my sport, Ultimate Frisbee. As a child, I wanted to be a fashion designer but as 
I grew, I realized that there was so much more to consider than being driven by passion alone. I was not a fan of math, in fact I hated it,
but it really was effective to try to learn to love what you hate and keep a constant mindset. As I started to enjoy it, along with 
assembly of components in circuits and basic programming, with all the courage, I decided to take up Engineering. 
Tas eto na ako mam, charan!! HAHAHAHA
